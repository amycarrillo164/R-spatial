library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(stringr)
library(mapview)

```

## Step 1. Join the COVID-19 data to the NYC zip code area data (sf or sp polygons).

```{r}
# Set working directory
wd <- dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path)
setwd(wd)

```

```{r}
# add NYC zip code shapefile
zipcode <- st_read("data/hw_data/ZIP_CODE_040114.shp")
str(zipcode)

```
## STEP 2.Aggregate the NYC food retails store data (points) to the zip code data, so that we know how many retail stores in each zip code area. Note that not all locations are for food retail. And we need to choose the specific types according to the data.

```{r}
# Add NYC food retails store data (points)
food_retails_xy <- read.csv("data/hw_data/nys_retail_food_store_xy.csv", fileEncoding = "Latin1", check.names = F)

# Clean data
food_retails_xy <- clean_names(food_retails_xy)

food_retails_NY <- food_retails_xy %>%
  filter(zip_code > 7000) %>%
  filter(i_county %in% c("Bronx", "Kings","Queens", "New York","Richmond")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(x)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(y))

```


```{r}
# Turning csv into sf. Process the location column using stringr
st_as_sf(food_retails_NY %>% tidyr::drop_na(x, y), coords = c('x', 'y')) -> food_retailsNY_SF

# Assign coordinate system
st_crs(food_retailsNY_SF) <- 4326

```

Side Note: Establishment codes. https://data.ny.gov/Economic-Development/Retail-Food-Stores/9a8c-vfzj
            C = Food manufacturer.

```{r}
# Filter the data to only food retails
ET = c("JAC", "JABC", "JABCP", "JACDK", "JABCDP", "JACD","JACFS", "JABCHK", "JACHK", "JABCK", "JACK", "JACDHK", "JACH", "JACDE", "JABCH", "JABCDH", "JABCD", "JACE", "JACI", "JACO ", "JACDH", "JABCG", "JACV", "JABCOP", "JAK ", "JACL", "JACG", "JABCDK", "JACZ", "JACW", "JCA", "JACDKM", "JABCGP", "JACN", "JABCKO", "JABCW", "JACDIK", "JACS", "JABCO", "JACDG", "JACP", "JABCHO", "JACHOP", "JACHO", "JACEW", "JDAC", "JKDAC", "JACHKO", "JACEK")

# First trim off the extra white space in establishment_type columns
food_retailNY_SF2 <- food_retailsNY_SF %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), str_trim))
  
food_retailNY_SF3 <- food_retailNY_SF2 %>%
  filter(establishment_type %in% ET)

view(food_retailNY_SF3)

```


```{r}
# Aggregate the NYC food retails store data (points) to the zip code data...specific to food retail
food_retails_zipSummary <- food_retailNY_SF3 %>%
  group_by(zip_code)%>%
  summarise(Total_Stores = n(),
            .groups = 'drop')

view(food_retails_zipSummary)

```


## sTEP 3. Aggregate the NYC health facilities (points) to the zip code data. Similarly, choose appropriate subtypes such as nursing homes from the facilities.

```{r}
# Add NYC health facilties data (points)
HealthFacilties_data <- read.csv("data/hw_data/NYS_Health_Facility.csv")

# Clean data
HealthFacilties_data <- clean_names(HealthFacilties_data)
str(HealthFacilties_data)

```

```{r}
# Turning health facilties csv into sf. 

#Process the location column using stringr
leftPos <- stringr::str_locate(HealthFacilties_data$facility_location, "\\(")[,1]
rghtPos <- stringr::str_locate(HealthFacilties_data$facility_location, "\\)")[,1]

# Get the coordinates text
HealthFacilties_data$facility_location %>% stringr::str_sub(leftPos+1, rghtPos -1) -> HealthFacilties_data$coords
cmmaPos <- stringr::str_locate(HealthFacilties_data$coords, ", ")

#Get the numeric coordinates
HealthFacilties_data$Y <- stringr::str_sub(HealthFacilties_data$coords, 1, cmmaPos[,1]-1) %>% as.numeric()
HealthFacilties_data$X <- stringr::str_sub(HealthFacilties_data$coords, cmmaPos[,2]+1) %>% as.numeric()

# Take out the rows without coordinates and make a sf object
st_as_sf(HealthFacilties_data %>% tidyr::drop_na(X, Y), coords = c('X', 'Y')) -> HealthFacilties_SF

# Assign coordinate system
st_crs(HealthFacilties_SF) <- 4326

view(HealthFacilties_SF)
```


```{r}
# Filter appropriate subtypes such as nursing homes from the facilities. 
## HF includes hospitals, clinics, and mdeical centers.

HF <- c("Diagnostic and Treatment Center","Hospital Extension Clinic","Hospital","Diagnostic and Treatment Center Extension Clinic","Primary Care Hospital - Critical Access Hospital Extension Clinic", "Primary Care Hospital - Critical Access Hospital")

HF_SF <- HealthFacilties_SF %>%
  filter(description %in% HF)

view(HF_SF)

```

```{r}
#Create sf objects from geographic coordinates for NYC

NYC_HealthFacilties_SF <- HF_SF %>%
  filter(facility_county %in% c("Bronx", "Kings","Queens", "New York","Richmond"))

view(NYC_HealthFacilties_SF)
```


## Step 4. Join the Census ACS population, race, and age data to the NYC Planning Census Tract Data.

## Step 5: Aggregate the ACS census data to zip code area data.
